1. Do NOT include any text that appeared on the PDF that is irrelevant to the page contents (ex: the timestamp, the contents of the title element which can be set to whatever you want, the URL, and the page number)

2. The SVG does **not** have to exactly match the one provided in the PDF, but it should show reasonable effort to match the **context** of the given page.  

3. **For full credit** in the *Quick Feedback* section:  
   - Under **Favorite Coffee**, you are free to choose 5 or more options of your choice, but separate options into two categories:  
     - Common coffee types (found in most coffee shops)  
     - Niche or rare coffee types  

4. In the *Coolest-sounding keyword* section, you are free to choose 3 or more keywords from the article of your choice, but note that the placeholder text says **"type or choose"**.  
   - Hint: Which HTML element can both **list suggested values** *and* **accept any valid input**?  

5. The information directly under **"QED-3000 technical specs & example commands"** should stay hidden until the **triangle next to it is clicked**.  
   - Hint: Thereâ€™s an HTML element that does this **without scripting or CSS**.  

6. For **Table 1: Productivity improvements by group**:  
   - You may modify the style to adjust the **width** of individual columns. Otherwise, the minimal-CSS rule from other parts apply.
   - You may also change attributes like **`span`** (big hint!).  

7. The **search-related form** does not need to function at this time.

8. For the image in figure 1, use the sample image provided as the source. Width was set to 400, height to 300.
